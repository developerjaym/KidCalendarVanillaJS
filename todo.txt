1. Add something like 'seriesId' to calendarEntryActivities
   That will allow me to 'update series' and 'delete series', etc.

2. I should stop using a State class and the other classes and just work with pure js objects.
   That will make everything so much easier.
   const state = {
    "2022-10-10": [
            {
                id: 1,
                seriesId: 1,
                text: "preschool",
                icon: "..."
            }
        ]
   }
    That's far easier to add activities to. state = {
        ...state, "2022-10-10": [
            ...state["2022-10-10"], {
                id: 2,
                seriesId: 2,
                text: "church",
                icon: "..."
            }
        ]
    }
